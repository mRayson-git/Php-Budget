# Php-Budget
Project building off of the lessons I learned in my Command Line Budget
Application. Uses html, php and mysql to:

1) Allow multiple users to store their own profile
2) Save financial transactions to a database
3) Easily search and modify those transactions from a table view
4) Create and predict monthly budget plans

Here are some images of the current UI for the application:
